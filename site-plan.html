        sit unused? My goal is to turn those paper weights into fun moments and memories with friends
        and family. My website will guide you and your party to new and exciting games that are easy to
        learn and will completely transform those 52 cards. With over 1,000 different games to choose

      <h5>Learning and Teaching</h5>
      <p>
        A deck of cards is something everyone is familiar with, but learning new ways to use it will provide an aspect of curiosity. Using a common object that the majority of people own as the center of entertainment will make it even easier for nearly all visitors of the website to be able to use my content. Learning something new can sometimes be intimidating, but many visitors will take the time to apply themselves to learn, especially if they have a good reason. One of those reasons could be wanting to entertain a group of friends and/or family members. Teaching others how to play the games discovered on my site will solidify the learning curve and the games will be something they can use in many different situations and circumstances. They will likely recommend my site to their friends and family which will create an even bigger audience.
      </p>
      <h5>The Real Value</h5>
      <p>My site will draw many visitors because the entertainment offered is not the newest and most modern, but instead is a little retro. People love reflecting on the past and everyone has fond memories they dwell on. Before technology became so advanced, people with their families spent time playing board and card games. This aspect of using cards will make people feel like they are “going back in time,” or catching a break from it all. Quality time and entertainment will also help the user and those involved feel happy and should have a positive influence on their emotional state.

      <h3>How to Use</h3>
      <h5>How Content is Displayed</h5>
      <p>
        Being clear, concise, and able to be understood by everyone is very important. The instructions for each game should have all the rules, the set up, the process, how to win, and an example of game play posted (with pictures as necessary). Having an option for the visitors to ask questions and get answers about the games should also be an option just in case something was left out of one of the instructions. Then the instructions can be updated and more comprehensive. 
      </p>
      <h5>How Site is Organized</h5>
      <p>In order for the visitors to get the game that best matches their current needs, the games will be organized into different categories. These will be the difficulty to learn or complexity, estimated game duration, number of players, and required materials to play (number of decks, paper, or other materials). Because of the quantity of games available, this way of filtering through all the content will be necessary in order for it to be practical to use.</p>

      <h3>Why Use</h3>
      <h5>Why Come</h5>
      <p>
        One of the biggest parts in our modern culture is the way in which we find things to entertain us. With the release of the iPhone in 2007, millions of people now idle away their free time by scrolling on social media, binge watching tv series, video games, etc. We share videos and content that we find entertaining with those we care about. My website is designed to bring people looking for entertainment. With so many options and different games to play, it is almost certain that visitors will return to play more games and to try new things.
      </p>
      <h5>Why Here</h5>
      <p>
        My site will be used instead of others because it will be such a large database that contains so many different games. It will be so easily read and accessible that the visitors will like using it and become accustomed to the format quickly. As far as I am aware, there are not very many sites that offer so many card games, which makes my site unique. The majority of people know only a handful of games that can be played with a standard deck. My site will have dozens of games that will be completely new to the visitors.
