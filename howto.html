        <h5>How Content is Displayed</h5>
      <p>
        Being clear, concise, and able to be understood by everyone is very important. The instructions for each game should have all the rules, the set up, the process, how to win, and an example of game play posted (with pictures as necessary). Having an option for the visitors to ask questions and get answers about the games should also be an option just in case something was left out of one of the instructions. Then the instructions can be updated and more comprehensive.

      <h5>How Site is Organized</h5>
      <p>In order for the visitors to get the game that best matches their current needs, the games will be organized into different categories. These will be the difficulty to learn or complexity, estimated game duration, number of players, and required materials to play (number of decks, paper, or other materials). Because of the quantity of games available, this way of filtering through all the content will be necessary in order for it to be practical to use.</p>
