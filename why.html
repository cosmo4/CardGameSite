      <h5>Why Come</h5>
      <p>
        One of the biggest parts in our modern culture is the way in which we find things to entertain us. With the release of the iPhone in 2007, millions of people now idle away their free time by scrolling on social media, binge watching tv series, video games, etc. We share videos and content that we find entertaining with those we care about. My website is designed to bring people looking for entertainment. With so many options and different games to play, it is almost certain that visitors will return to play more games and to try new things.

      <h5>Why Here</h5>
      <p>
        My site will be used instead of others because it will be such a large database that contains so many different games. It will be so easily read and accessible that the visitors will like using it and become accustomed to the format quickly. As far as I am aware, there are not very many sites that offer so many card games, which makes my site unique. The majority of people know only a handful of games that can be played with a standard deck. My site will have dozens of games that will be completely new to the visitors.
